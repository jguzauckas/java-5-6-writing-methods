# Initial Try

In the `Student.java` file, can you complete the `gradeNextYear` and `sayFullName` methods?

The `sayFullName` method should print the student's full name using their `firstName` and `lastName` with a space in between.

When done correctly, the `TestStudent.java` file should have no errors and print the following output when run:
