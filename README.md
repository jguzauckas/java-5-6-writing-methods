# AP Computer Science A - Unit 5 Section 6

# Writing Methods

This section opens us up to the general world of methods, and how we write them to accomplish tasks.

This section covers the following material:

- non-void with parameters - computes and returns'
- pass by value
    - primitive types are copies
    - objects are aliases
- Only accessing private data of objects of the enclosing class
    - Good practice to not modify mutable objects

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
